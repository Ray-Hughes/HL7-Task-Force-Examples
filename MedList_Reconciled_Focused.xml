<!-- A Reconciled Medication section

		The following is based on the IHE Reconciliation of Clinical Content and Care Providers (RECON) - Revised 2016-11-11 profile
				http://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_RECON.pdf

		Indicating that a section (list) has been reconciled is accomplished by two levels of content, one required and one optional:
			1) Required: human readable text
				from IHE RECON: For every reconciled list within the document, the human readable text SHALL contain some indication that the list was reconciled, by whom and when the reconciliation occurred.
			2) Optional: a Reconciliation Act for each section that is reconciled
				from IHE RECON: SHOULD support the Reconciliation Content Option

		See: Figure X-1: Example of a Reconciled Medication List in the IHE RECON profile for a nice visual.

		It is important to recognize that this is reconciliation of all items in the section, not of some items within the section. One reconciles the whole (medication, problem, allergy, ...providers) list
			i.e., your original list is compared to some other list to produce this new, reconciled list.

	For purposes of this example, the text of the medications, and the entries for each, are removed so we can focus on the 2 indocations of reconciliation.
