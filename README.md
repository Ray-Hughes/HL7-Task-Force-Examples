# These are some example C-CDAs created by John D'Amore for the HL7 Example Task Force


### What's here now
Four lab entries and five medication entries. Note that not all have been approved by HL7

### Why?
*Lots* of people will be implementing CCDA very soon; many have already started.
But there are big questions about how to do what, and while an excellent 
implementation guide is a must, examples matter too.  The community would
benefit immensely from a public collection of examples that can be:
 * dissected,
 * discussed, and 
 * corrected over time.
(Note I stole the above text from CHB/J Mandel's Github repo for C-CDA documents submitted by EHR/HIT. Check that out @ https://github.com/chb/sample_ccdas)

### Fine print
Samples posted here may not been approved by HL7 or any other body. They are educated guesses and may change over time. The C-CDA Skeleton being used in my examples was developed by Lisa Nelson and is available at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccda_samples
